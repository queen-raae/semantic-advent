## Element post Template

You can copy this and use it as a starting point for your post. It's not set in stone; feel free to change it up if it does not make sense for you or your element.

```

// src/content/elements/<element>.md

---

author: @you-x-handle
excerpt: A short teaser for the element (optional)

---

Short intro, will be used as the excerpt if no excerpt in frontmatter.

> Add the description from MDN to give folks an official description of the element.

Tell personal story, or talk about a real world use case when you used this element.

Add a demo of the element in action. Preferably a CodePen! Some element don't look good by default and many devs therefore skip using it, so showcase how to style and use it sensibly with real world data.

If there are any accissibility concerns, or gains, mention them here.

Some ending remarks, maybe some links to other resources.
